# Machine-learning-with-python
From formula to python codes.

This repository concentrates on how to translate formula commonly found in papers (focused ML, AI and DL) into a python code. The focus is not on how to build a fully fledged method/algorithm but rather how to implement its building blocks. As an example: *rather thank showing you how to build an entire DL framework, this repository will show how to code a ReLu activation function instead*. Most of the articles will be implemented in a python notebook as it offers the best application to combine comments, codes and plotting.
